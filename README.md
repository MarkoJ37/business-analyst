## Project: Google Sheets-Based Order and Inventory Management System

This project integrates WooCommerce, Google Sheets, and AppSheet to streamline eCommerce operations, including order processing, inventory management, and live performance reporting. It features real-time dashboards, manual courier list generation, and procurement tracking, providing actionable insights and ensuring efficient workflows.

#### Key Features
- WooCommerce Integration via Apps Script
  - A custom Google Apps Script connects Google Sheets to WooCommerce’s API.
  - Orders from WooCommerce are fetched in real-time and displayed in the Orders Tab.
- Order Management and Shipping Label Preparation
  - In the Orders Tab, users select orders by checking a box.
  - Selected orders are added to a courier-specific list.
  - Users download the courier list as a tab from Google Sheets and email it to the courier, as per the client’s preference.
  - Couriers use the list to generate shipping labels for packaging.
- Inventory Management via AppSheet
  - An Inventory Tab tracks product stock levels in real-time.
  - Integrated with an AppSheet app, which facilitates procurement processes by allowing users to update inventory directly.
  - Orders with insufficient inventory are flagged in red, signaling a need for stock replenishment.
- Reporting System
  - Order Reporting: Tracks real-time sales metrics, including total revenue, order counts, and product performance.
  - Ad Spend vs. Sales Reporting: Compares sales revenue with advertising expenditure to inform product strategy and pricing adjustments.
  - Reports are live and updated throughout the month, providing continuous visibility into eCommerce performance.

#### Metrics and Functionality
- Key Metric: Revenue and product-specific sales performance, aiding in strategic decisions for product pricing and inventory prioritization.
- Nature of Reports:
  - Live, Tabular Format: Focused on operational needs with real-time updates throughout the month.
  - Visualizations (Future Scope): Quarterly and yearly reports include charts and graphs to analyze long-term trends but are not part of the live system example.

#### Technical Workflow
- Order Processing:
  - Real-time synchronization with WooCommerce API retrieves order data.
  - Manual export of courier-specific lists for shipping label generation.
- Inventory Management:
  - Dynamic AppSheet integration keeps inventory status updated.
  - Conditional formatting highlights low stock levels.
- Real-Time Reporting:
  - Automated calculations generate insights into revenue trends and product performance.
  - Dashboards update in real-time for operational monitoring.
